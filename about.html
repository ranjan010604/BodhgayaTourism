                <p>Bodh GayƒÅ is a religious site and place of pilgrimage associated with the Mahabodhi Temple complex,
                    situated in the Gaya district in the Indian state of Bihar. It is famous for being the place where
                    Gautama Buddha is said to have attained enlightenment (Pali: bodhi) under what became known as the
                    Bodhi Tree<br>Bodh Gaya is considered to be the holiest site in Buddhism.[7] Known as Uruvela in the
                    Buddha's time, it is situated by the bank of the Lilajan River. The first temple at the site was
                    built by Maurya Emperor Ashoka.<br>At this place, the Buddha was abandoned by the five men who had
                    been his companions in his earlier austerities. All they saw was an ordinary man; they mocked his
                    well-nourished appearance. "Here comes the mendicant Gautama," they said, "who has turned away from
                    asceticism. He is certainly not worth our respect." When they reminded him of his former vows, the
                    Buddha replied, "Austerities only confuse the mind. In the exhaustion and mental stupor to which
                    they lead, one can no longer understand the ordinary things of life, still less the truth that lies
                    beyond the senses. I have given up extremes of either luxury or asceticism. I have discovered the
                    Middle Way." This is explained as the path which is neither easy (his former life as a rich prince)
                    nor hard (living in austere conditions, practicing self-denial). Hearing this, the five ascetics
                    became the Buddha's first disciples in Deer Park, Sarnath, which is situated 13 kilometres northeast
                    of Benares.</p>
